# Solution Description

I decided to implement the programming assignment via a lightweight, static website page. This makes it accessible to anyone with a modern web browser.

Most notably, my implementation allows the user to upload any number of xml-screenshot pairs, and have them all processed at once. Partially for my own convenience and sanity when testing and procuring results.

I also designed the application such that images can be downloaded en masse in a zip file. Also for convenience and sanity.

Since I had the time, I decided to make it look nice, as well. While not strictly necessary, it was enjoyable.
